00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:37,269
Students, I would love to
introduce you all

3
00:00:37,394 --> 00:00:39,081
to the future, mkay?

4
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,333
Starting today, our school

5
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:44,318
will be operating entirely
on Intelilink.

6
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:47,325
Now whenever you need to see
the school nurse

7
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,269
or talk to me, your counselor,
you can simply sign up

8
00:00:50,394 --> 00:00:52,346
using this simple integrated portal.

[Click]

12
00:00:57,775 --> 00:01:00,310
You can use a computer
or any of the Intelilink panels

13
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:02,479
which are located
throughout the school.

14
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,387
Let's say you're in
the cafeteria, mkay,

15
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,844
and you start coughing up blood
and need to see the nurse.

16
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:09,151
You just click on school clinic...
[Click]

17
00:01:09,276 --> 00:01:10,853

okay.
I must be in the wrong menu, mkay?

21
00:01:20,037 --> 00:01:23,041
You can see you can control
the sound system as well.

It's all integrated and smartlinked,

23
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:26,399
and this is a great idea, mkay?

24
00:01:26,524 --> 00:01:29,154
Let's look at the message board.

Message board.
[Click]

26
00:01:31,314 --> 00:01:33,336
Here you can easily write
messages to each other

27
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:35,929
or to the faculty, mkay?
For instance, here we go.

28
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,597
Here's a message from Kyle's
little brother, Ike Broflovski.

29
00:01:38,883 --> 00:01:42,444
Mkay, little Ike says,
"my brother is a homo."

30
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,563
[Laughing]

31
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,815
Ike made a little drawing of
his brother too.

32
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,269
Drew a nice picture with a nice bird

33
00:01:49,394 --> 00:01:51,361
hanging off Kyle's forehead.
Mkay, that's nice.

34
00:01:51,527 --> 00:01:53,030
Ha ha ha ha ha!

35
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,122
That's a nice crane,

36
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,283
nice whooping crane coming off
Kyle's head there.

37
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,932
That's not a crane.
It's a dick and balls.

38
00:01:58,057 --> 00:01:59,870
[Snickering]

39
00:02:02,809 --> 00:02:05,269
Mom, Ike did it again.

40
00:02:05,394 --> 00:02:06,933
I don't know
what's going on with him,

41
00:02:07,058 --> 00:02:08,360
but it's like he hates me.

42
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:11,269
Oh, Kyle, your little brother
is getting older.

43
00:02:11,394 --> 00:02:12,858
He's not a baby anymore.

44
00:02:12,983 --> 00:02:15,923
I know, but he posted a message of me
with a schlong on my head.

45
00:02:16,048 --> 00:02:18,441
It's natural, bubie.
Part of getting older

46
00:02:18,566 --> 00:02:20,269
is finding ways to assert
your independence.

47
00:02:20,394 --> 00:02:21,299
You know.

48
00:02:21,424 --> 00:02:24,607
Why don't you go and try to talk to him.
You can win him over again.

49
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:30,942
Hey, Ike.
How's it going?

50
00:02:31,394 --> 00:02:34,116
Get out of my room, Kyle.
I'm on my computer.

51
00:02:35,883 --> 00:02:38,325
I just wanted to see if maybe you
wanna do finger paints with me?

52
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,869
Do I look like I want to do
fucking finger paints?

53
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,968
Look at the fucking zits on my face.

54
00:02:44,587 --> 00:02:46,834
Ike, I just want us to be
friends again.

55
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,023
Then stop harassing me, bro.

56
00:02:49,148 --> 00:02:51,542
You don't know what it's like to
be a baby going through puberty.

57
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:53,269
I don't know whether to watch
<i>Yo Gabba Gabba</i>

58
00:02:53,394 --> 00:02:54,936
or go out and tame some strange!

59
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:58,921
Yeah, let's watch
<i>Yo Gabba Gabba</i> like old times.

00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:07,521
? Come on, let's dance

00:03:07,906 --> 00:03:09,269
? Go, go, go, brobee

65
00:03:09,394 --> 00:03:10,871
Dancey dance is my favorite.

66
00:03:10,996 --> 00:03:13,652
It always has been.

? Come on, let's dance

70
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,965
Who would you rather fuck,
Foofa or Toodee?

71
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,621
- What?
- I wanna fuck Foofa.

? Come on, let's dance

73
00:03:26,914 --> 00:03:28,269
I wouldn't want to fuck Toodee.

74
00:03:28,394 --> 00:03:29,573
She's a dyke.
You can tell.

75
00:03:29,698 --> 00:03:32,415
But Foofa, man...
I bet she's got some sweet strange.

76
00:03:34,926 --> 00:03:37,175
I don't even know
what the fucking Muno is.

77
00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:38,887
Ike, is that chewing tobacco?

78
00:03:39,012 --> 00:03:41,046
What, you gonna fucking narc
and tell Mom?

79
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:42,647
No, I just don't think it's healthy.

80
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:44,474
That's 'cause you don't
understand shit!

81
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,048
I knew this was a bad idea!

82
00:03:46,173 --> 00:03:49,479
I'm gonna go watch

Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you?

85
00:03:55,484 --> 00:03:57,269
Mkay, have you set up
a counseling appointment

86
00:03:57,394 --> 00:03:59,321
- on Intelilink?
- No.

Okay, that's fine, that's fine.

88
00:04:01,365 --> 00:04:02,845

It's my little brother.

What?

Sorry, Kyle we're gonna need
to go somewhere else.

Let's find an Intelilink panel

Okay, now, Kyle, you have some
concerns about your little brother?

He's just changing a lot.

120
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,144
He walks around angry,
telling me I'm stupid,

121
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:14,898
and all he talks about is sex.

122
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,608
Well, it sounds like
he's hitting puberty.

123
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,568
Yeah, he just seems so young.

124
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:20,350
Well, your brother is Canadian.

125
00:05:20,475 --> 00:05:22,707
Perhaps Canadian puberty
is a little different.

126
00:05:23,117 --> 00:05:25,636
Why don't you educate yourself
about Canadian puberty,

127
00:05:25,761 --> 00:05:27,269
and it can be something
you and your brother

128
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:28,954
can actually do together, mkay?

129

[Plop, splash]

130

This is the first time
I've been able to do counseling

00:05:33,005 --> 00:05:34,950
and go to the bathroom
at the same time.

132
00:05:35,075 --> 00:05:36,687
Intelilink is amazing.

133
00:05:46,258 --> 00:05:47,356
Hello, young people,

134
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:49,888
and welcome to the most
fascinating time of your life.

135
00:05:50,013 --> 00:05:51,774
You have braved
the trials of childhood

136
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:54,145
and now you are reaching
Canadian puberty.

137
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:56,910
By now you've probably noticed
some changes in your body.

138
00:05:57,035 --> 00:05:59,256
For instance, when you fart
your dick gets hard.

139
00:06:04,295 --> 00:06:06,603
Other physical changes are
happening to your body as well.

140
00:06:06,728 --> 00:06:08,936
If you're a boy, you may notice
that your testicles ache.

141
00:06:09,061 --> 00:06:10,363
Or if you're a girl, you may notice

142
00:06:10,488 --> 00:06:12,225
a tingling sensation in your strange.

143
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,594
This stupid, bro.
I already know all this.

144
00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:17,794
Let's just give it a chance, Ike.

145
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,151
Going through Canadian puberty,

146
00:06:19,276 --> 00:06:21,472
you may notice that your voice
is starting to change as well.

147
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:24,119
You're saying things like,
"hey, buddy," and, "hey, guy,"

148
00:06:24,244 --> 00:06:25,832
because now that you're older,
you're discovering

149
00:06:25,957 --> 00:06:28,221
that someone who was once
your buddy is now your guy.

150
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:29,454
And someone who you used to call guy

151

152
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,811
But now let's discuss how a man
and woman make love.

153
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,147
First, a man and a woman
fall in love.

154
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,339
Then the man farts
on the woman's strange...

155
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:41,436
Filling the woman's strange with air

156
00:06:41,561 --> 00:06:43,186
so the woman can queef
in the man's face,

157
00:06:43,757 --> 00:06:45,447
and the baby is born.

158
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,809
The entire process can take up
to six months...

159
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:49,532
It's what?

160
00:06:50,522 --> 00:06:51,825
That's not how babies are born?

161
00:06:53,683 --> 00:06:54,833
What's semen?

162
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,952
Then why did my wife queef
in my face?

163
00:06:59,245 --> 00:07:00,436
She said it was to...

164
00:07:00,747 --> 00:07:01,789
Then why would sh...

165
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:04,215
I'm going to get to the bottom
of this.

166
00:07:04,381 --> 00:07:05,999
Make me look like an idiot, will you?

167
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,269
Hey, you told me you
queefed in my face

168
00:07:09,394 --> 00:07:10,561
because that's how babies are born.

169
00:07:10,686 --> 00:07:12,745
- I was being sarcastic.
- Being sarcastic?

170
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,941
I just told a million Canadian
teenagers that's how it's done.

171
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:16,788
I was angry because
you never listen to me

172
00:07:16,913 --> 00:07:18,239
because I wanted you to go
with me to therapy,

173
00:07:18,364 --> 00:07:20,113
- and you never go.
- Fine! You want to go

174
00:07:20,238 --> 00:07:21,566
with you to therapy?
Fine!

175
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,064
Totally embarrassing and degrading.

176
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:24,974
- She queefed right in my face.
- Maybe you should spend

177
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:26,587
less time at work making
public health films

178
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:27,864
and more time at home.

179
00:07:28,786 --> 00:07:30,201
What the fuck is going on?

180
00:07:30,326 --> 00:07:32,309
You're fucking stupid, Kyle.

00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:44,999
I don't know what else to do, dude.

183
00:07:45,124 --> 00:07:48,126
No matter what I try, me and Ike
seem to drift further apart.

184
00:07:48,251 --> 00:07:50,399
He doesn't ever want
to play with you anymore?

187
00:07:53,477 --> 00:07:55,858
- What?
- I said, that sucks dude.

What were you trying to do, Kyle?

194
00:08:05,795 --> 00:08:07,423
I was trying to make an appointment

195
00:08:07,548 --> 00:08:09,474
to see the principal about
getting excused on Friday

196

so I can take my brother
to see <i>Yo Gabba Gabba</i> live.

Mr. Mackey, can he just
go talk to the principal?

198
00:08:14,483 --> 00:08:16,927
No, this is gonna work.
I called Intelilink,

aren't intelligrated.

you might want to upgrade your
system to the silver package.

I needed the silver package?
Can we do that?

to save your marriage

299

you need to figure it out quick.

an unmitigated disaster.

303
00:12:27,099 --> 00:12:28,383

463
00:18:44,641 --> 00:18:46,998
Then we wipe all the computers
of Intellilink software,

464
00:18:47,123 --> 00:18:48,885
and you never deal with us again.

465
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,158
All right.

466
00:18:52,283 --> 00:18:53,771
Upgrade me to the centurion package

467
00:18:53,896 --> 00:18:54,946
right away.

468
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:04,244
All right, sir,
here a clipboard you can use

469
00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:05,647
for students to sign up
for counseling,

470
00:19:05,772 --> 00:19:07,955
and I want to thank you
for using Intellilink.

471
00:19:13,649 --> 00:19:16,242
The MTV Video Music Awards
will be back

472
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:19,171
with a performance from
<i>Yo Gabba Gabba's</i> Foofa

473
00:19:19,296 --> 00:19:22,161
singing <i>Pound My Sweet Strange.</i>

474
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,358
Two minutes, Foofa.

475
00:19:24,483 --> 00:19:26,877
Thanks.
Oh, my, here we go.

476
00:19:27,002 --> 00:19:28,589
Ike, wait.

477
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,419
Get out of here, dude.

478
00:19:30,585 --> 00:19:33,047
There's been a mistake.
You don't understand.

479
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,713
No, you don't understand, wuss.

480
00:19:34,838 --> 00:19:36,525
Why can't you just let me grow up?

481
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,552
Why do you keep harassing me?

482
00:19:38,718 --> 00:19:41,097
Because you're my little
brother, goddamn it,

483
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:44,108
and even when I'm 50 and you're 45,

484
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:46,393
you're still gonna be
my little brother.

485
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,938
All right, y'all, here comes
our next big act.

486
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,292
Ike, I don't care if you want
to grow up.

487
00:19:51,417 --> 00:19:53,734
I just want to be by
your side while you do it.

488
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,921
Give it up for the sexiest
bitch on earth.

489
00:19:56,046 --> 00:19:57,671
It's Foofa!
[Cheers and applause]

490
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:00,016
Come on, Ike.

491
00:20:00,578 --> 00:20:01,261
Ike?

492
00:20:01,386 --> 00:20:03,308
He's right, Foof.
Part of growing up

493
00:20:03,433 --> 00:20:05,085
is rebelling, but I'm gonna get older

494
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,828
whether I like it or not.
So why push it?

495
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:10,657
I think I'm gonna let it
happen naturally.

496
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,338
- Yay!
- Yay!

497
00:20:14,219 --> 00:20:15,339
Foofa?

498
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,308
? Come on, come on

499
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:25,797
? Pound my strange

500
00:20:26,045 --> 00:20:28,310
♪ Pound it like this,
pound it like that ♪

501
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,645
It was a mistake.

502
00:20:35,129 --> 00:20:35,799
What?

503
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,958
Trying to reform Canada's
health care system

504
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,329
and being too stubborn
to admit it wasn't working...

505
00:20:40,454 --> 00:20:42,645
Even when my wife said the
system was too complicated.

506
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:43,862
I wouldn't listen!

507
00:20:43,987 --> 00:20:46,716
Oh, Terry, I was trying
to get your attention.

508
00:20:46,964 --> 00:20:48,914
I'm sorry I queefed in your face.

509
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,967
I deserved it.

510
00:20:50,092 --> 00:20:51,971
Anyone who thinks streamlining
health care

511
00:20:52,096 --> 00:20:54,194
into an integrated computer
system would go smoothly

512
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,241
deserves a giant queef in their face.

513
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,349
Thank you, my lady.

514
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,449
So Intellilink is gone, my lord?

515
00:21:00,574 --> 00:21:03,053
Yes, I've upgraded
to the gold package.

516
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:04,912
Within no time, Canadians everywhere

517
00:21:05,037 --> 00:21:06,463
will be getting
their correct medications

518
00:21:06,588 --> 00:21:08,684
and going back to normal.

519
00:21:09,362 --> 00:21:11,310
[Baby laughing]

520
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,645
- Ike?
- Kyle.

521
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:24,074
It's Dora The Explorer!

522
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,118
Come on, let's climb the mountain.

523
00:21:26,284 --> 00:21:28,665
It sure is!
You want me to watch it with you, Ike?

524
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,956
Yay.

525
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:32,291
We made it to the top.

526
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,793
Oh, man, I wouldn't mind
hitting that.

527
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:37,970
I bet she's got that hot
Puerto Rican strange.

528
00:21:38,947 --> 00:21:40,585
Yeah, I bet she does.

529
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,343
Yay!

530
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:45,346
